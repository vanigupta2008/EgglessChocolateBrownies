Preparation For Chocolate Brownie Recipe
Grease a 7 x 2 inches square baking pan with some oil.
First measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.
In a mixing bowl or pan, take 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (atta), 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of salt.

With a whisk, mix everything very well. You can even sift this flour mixture if you want. Keep aside. Preheat the oven at 200 degrees celsius/392 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes.

Preparing Cocoa Solution For Brownie Recipe
Now take 1 cup water in a pan and heat it on a low to medium flame.
When the water become hot, lower the flame and then add 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder and then add 4 tablespoons oil.
With a spatula begin to mix everything very well. The sugar should dissolve and the cocoa powder should mix evenly with water. With the spatula or whisk, break the lumps of cocoa powder if any.
Let this mixture come to a boil.

Making Chocolate Brownie Batter
Switch off the flame and add the bubbling hot cocoa mixture to the dry flour mixture.
Also add vanilla extract.
With a spatula or wired whisk, begin to mix both the wet and dry ingredients lightly.

The mixture will be hot, so be careful while mixing and also mix lightly. Do not over do. A few tiny flour specks in the batter are fine.
The brownie batter has a thick consistency and does not flow freely but loose (much like a halwa consistency). 
If the batter looks too much thick, then the one showed in pic 15 below, then please add a few tablespoons of hot water and then mix again. 
The water required depends on the quality of whole wheat flour. So please keep some hot water handy, if you need to add it.
Now place the brownie batter with the spatula in the baking pan.
Shake the pan, so that the batter spreads and evens out. Also using a spatula spread and make the batter even.

Baking Chocolate Brownie
Bake brownie in the pre heated oven at 200 degrees celsius/392 degrees fahrenheit for 30 to 40 minutes. Do not open the oven door till 3/4th of the brownie is done. Since oven temperatures vary, do keep a check. In a convection oven, preheat as well as bake at 180 degrees celsius.
Check with a tooth pick and if the tooth pick comes out clean, remove the pan from the oven. 
Do not over bake the brownie as then the top will get dried out and become crusty.
Once the brownie becomes warm or cools down, you can remove it from the tray or you can slice in the baking pan itself.
Slice and serve chocolate brownies. If not serving immediately, then store in an air tight container in the fridge. In a cool and cold climate, you can keep these brownies outside at room temperature for 1 to 2 days.
While serving brownies, you can sprinkle some powdered sugar on top. 
You can even serve the brownies with some chocolate or caramel syrup on top. Or make a dessert of vanilla ice cream served with the brownies.
